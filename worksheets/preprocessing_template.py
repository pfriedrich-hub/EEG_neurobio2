# Load the raw EEG data

# Filtering

# Rereferencing

# Apply ICA and remove unwanted ICA components (blinks, eye movements)

# Create epochs based on events

# Reject epochs based on criteria or find an automated tool to do it

# Average epochs --> evokeds

# Plot results

# Todo: include calculations for multiple subjects
